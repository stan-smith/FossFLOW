<b>Hey!</b> Stan here, if you've used FossFLOW and it's helped you, <b>I'd really appreciate if you could donate something small :)</b> I work full time, and finding the time to work on this project is challenging enough.
If you've had a feature that I've implemented for you, or fixed a bug it'd be great if you could :) if not, that's not a problem, this software will always remain free!

- Improved markdown editor styling

## Features

- 🎨 **Isometric Diagramming** - Create stunning 3D-style technical diagrams
- 💾 **Auto-Save** - Your work is automatically saved every 5 seconds
- 📱 **PWA Support** - Install as a native app on Mac and Linux
- 🔒 **Privacy-First** - All data stored locally in your browser
- 📤 **Import/Export** - Share diagrams as JSON files
- 🎯 **Session Storage** - Quick save without dialogs
- 🌐 **Offline Support** - Work without internet connection

## Try it online

Go to https://stan-smith.github.io/FossFLOW/

## 🐳 Quick Deploy with Docker

```bash
# Using Docker Compose (recommended - includes persistent storage)
docker compose up

# Or run directly from Docker Hub with persistent storage
docker run -p 80:80 -v $(pwd)/diagrams:/data/diagrams stnsmith/fossflow:latest
```

Server storage is enabled by default in Docker. Your diagrams will be saved to `./diagrams` on the host.

To disable server storage, set `ENABLE_SERVER_STORAGE=false`:
```bash
docker run -p 80:80 -e ENABLE_SERVER_STORAGE=false stnsmith/fossflow:latest
```

## Quick Start (Local Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stan-smith/FossFLOW
cd FossFLOW

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the library (required first time)
npm run build:lib

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Monorepo Structure

This is a monorepo containing two packages:

- `packages/fossflow-lib` - React component library for drawing network diagrams (built with Webpack)
- `packages/fossflow-app` - Progressive Web App for creating isometric diagrams (built with RSBuild)

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start app development server
npm run dev:lib      # Watch mode for library development

# Building
npm run build        # Build both library and app
npm run build:lib    # Build library only
npm run build:app    # Build app only

# Testing & Linting
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Check for linting errors

# Publishing
npm run publish:lib  # Publish library to npm
```

## How to Use

### Creating Diagrams

1. **Add Items**:
   - Press the "+" button on the top right menu, the library of components will appear on the left
   - Drag and drop components from the library onto the canvas
   - Or right-click on the grid and select "Add node"

2. **Connect Items**: 
   - Select the Connector tool (press 'C' or click connector icon)
   - **Click mode** (default): Click first node, then click second node
